# Unit Testing

This is a module created as a part of the 3rd assignment for the course Software Engineering in Practice offered by the department of Management Science and Technology of the Athens University of Economics and Business. 

It contains classes that do simple and complex arithmetic operations as well as input/output operations and their respective test classes.

The goal is to practice on unit testing using jUnit and mocks.

## Test the project

In order to test the project, the ``` junit ``` and the ``` mockito-core ``` dependencies were added in the parent's ``` pom.xml ``` file.  

You can simply run the tests using the Maven command  
``` 
mvn test
```

## Generate JaCoCo code coverage report 

In order to generate the JaCoCo coverage report, the ``` jacoco-maven-plugin ```was added in the parent's ``` pom.xml ``` file.

You can simply run the tests and get the code coverage report using the Maven command 
```
 mvn test jacoco:report 
```

You'll find the report generated by JaCoCo in the ``` target/site/jacoco ``` path of the module.
